# Quantum-Factoring21
Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm for factoring a number N in O((log N)3) time and O(log N) space, named after Peter Shor.

The problem we are trying to solve is that, given an integer N, we try to find another integer p between 1 and N that divides N.
Shor’s algorithm consists of two parts:
1. A reduction of the factoring problem to the problem of order-finding, which can be done on a classical computer.
2. A quantum algorithm to solve the order-finding problem.
